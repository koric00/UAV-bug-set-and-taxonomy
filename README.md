This data set contains 569 real world bugs, 168 UAV-specific bugs and their taxonomy. 
Our replication package consists of two maim folders：bugSet and bugTaxonomy

**bugSet**

In this folder we have placed all the bugs that we have indentified from PX4 and Ardupilot on GitHub. Data collection process is explained in detail in Section 3.1 of the paper. Each line in bugSet.xlsx provides project name and the link of 569 real-world bugs. 

**bugTaxonomy**

Our manual analysis was conducted in 3 iterations(Section 3.2 in the paper). In each file(3 iterations) we provide the following information: (a) Project name;(b)Bug link; (c)bug label or bug description.
